# Perfluoroelastomer Rubber

Perfluoroelastomer rubber is the final rubber used in the pack, and most resource efficient. It is made from tetrafluoroethylene, perfluoromethyl vinyl ether, and hexaflurobutadiene and requires at least

### How to make Tetrafluoroethylene

Tetrafluoroethylene can be made an <IV> **IV** </IV> Large Chemical Reactor using the reactor skip recipe at **Circuit 24**:

<!-- Add recipe -->

If availible, the Chemical Plant recipe can be used as well, where the Chemical Plant is set to **Circuit 1**:

### How to make Perfluoromethyl Vinyl Ether

Step 1: React ethylene, acetic acid, and oxygen in a normal / large chemical reactor at any tier, and set to **Circuit 3**:
