# Create Energy Production

Create can be used early on to generate power by converting stress to power. It is often used from LV to HV or early EV. <!-- Link back to other articles on create stress gen and over article-->

## Generator Construction

A generator is constructed using generator coils, carbon brushes, and magnets from Create: New Age. The steps to construct a generator is as follows:

1. Place generator coils in a line, connected by the central shaft running through them.
2. Surround the generator coils with magnet blocks.
3. Place a carbon brush on either end of the line of generator coils. <!-- Add images between steps-->

## Magnet Types

There are five tiers of magnets that generator coils can use, and they are as follows:

| Name | Magnetic Force |
|---|---|
| Magnetite Block | 1 |
| Redstone Magnet | 2 |
| Layered Magnet | 4 |
| Fluxuated Magnetite | 8 |
| Large Neodymium Magnet | 24 |

The magnetic force represents how much stress each magnet adds per RPM on top of the base consumption of the generator coils, which itself is 24 times RPM. For example, a generator coil spinning at 128 RPM surrounded fully by layered magnetite (12 magnets, magnetic force of 4) that generator coil would consume 9216 SU.

## Notes 

- Carbon brushes can handle a maximum of eight coils that aren't being handled by another carbon brush. For example, if a generator is eight generator coils long and carbon brushes are placed at each end, only one of the carbon brushes will work while the other will not.
- Magnet can be wall shared. This means that generators can use the same set of magnets to save resources.
