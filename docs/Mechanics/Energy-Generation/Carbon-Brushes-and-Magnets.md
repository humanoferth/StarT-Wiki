# Create Energy Production

Create can be used early on to generate power by converting stress to power. It is often used from LV to HV or early EV. <!-- Link back to other articles on create stress gen and over article-->

## Generator Construction

A generator is constructed using generator coils, carbon brushes, and magnets from Create: New Age. The steps to construct a generator is as follows:

1. Place generator coils in a line, connected by the central shaft running through them.
2. Surround the generator coils with magnet blocks.
3. Place a carbon brush on either end of the line of generator coils. <!-- Add images between steps-->

## Magnet Types

There are five tiers of magnets that generator coils can use, and they are as follows:

| Name | Magnetic Force |
|---|---|
| Magnetite Block | 1 |
| Redstone Magnet | 2 |
| Layered Magnet | 4 |
| Fluxuated Magnetite | 8 |
| Large Neodymium Magnet | 24 |

The magnetic force represents how much SU each magnet adds per RPM. For a generator coil spinning at 128 RPM, each magnetite block around it would consume 128 SU, each redstone magnet would consume 256 RPM, etc. The generator coil itself consumes 24 times the RPM its spinning at. For a generator coil spinning at 128 RPM with no magnets around it, it would consume 3,072 SU. A generator coil spinning at 128 RPM surrounded fully by 12 layered magnetite (each with a magnetic force of 4) would consume 9216 SU.

## Notes 

- Carbon brushes can handle a maximum of eight coils that aren't being handled by another carbon brush. For example, if a generator is eight generator coils long and carbon brushes are placed at each end, only one of the carbon brushes will work while the other will not, if the generator is nine generator coils long and carbon brushes are placed at each end, one carbon brush will produce power from eight of the coils while the other will produce power from one coil.
- Magnet can be wall shared. This means that generators can use the same set of magnets to save resources.
- It's important to try your best to use the best magnet available to you since
